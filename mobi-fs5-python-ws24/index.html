Thanks for the help and support :)) </li><li>I liked it and the support was great!</li><li>Thank you very much for the help during the lab sessions! I also found it really good that on both weeks we could do the tasks in our own pace. Maybe, after the discussed tasks, if you could upload a solution as well, to have an elegant solution to look at later, it would be great.</li></ol>
