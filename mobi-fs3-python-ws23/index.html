Vielleicht wäre eine Liste mit möglichen commands hilfreich</li><li>It would be great if we could have the right solution after a practical. This way we could look at the übung again at home without getting frustrated and having something to compare too. 
I know there are multiple right solutions, but we dont have any starting point and its difficult for a beginner to even start on the exercise.</li><li>I liked that the presentation of the results was of the beginning of the next session and not at the end of the same one, but maybe give enough time for everyone to load their code</li></ol>

                <p class="field_title">Do you have any general criticism or suggestions regarding the organization or the content of the course, or the course as a whole?</p>
                <p><b>13 answer(s)</b></p><ol start="5"><li>In general for someone who never coded before the organization in the data analysis part with Carl Hermann was much better. We watched the videos week by week and than had the tutorial every week directly after watching the video, sothat you have more knowledge memorized. Also for every tutorial we had a whole markdown sheet that gave an example how to use the code. After reading through the code I was able to use the code on a different dataset. Contrary in this course I constantly had the feeling that I can‘t do anything in python.</li><li>Please change the assignments pdf in a more detailed one. Also some instructions like import as were missing. And in the beginning of each lesson explain the codes we're gonna use while programming. The time we had to learn python was way to short, that's very sad, because I was so interessed and looked forward to learn it properly </li><li>Aside from presenting the solutions after the session (which was good as we could ask questions immediately), it would be very helpful nonetheless to have the solutions of all exercises uploaded at the end of the course. </li></ol>

                <p class="field_title">Do you have any general criticism or suggestions regarding the organization or the content of the course, or the course as a whole?</p>
                <p><b>13 answer(s)</b></p><ol start="8"><li>I think the tasks are explained proficiciently clear on the excercise sheet, so that the time spent on the presentation, in my opinion, could have been more useful for working on our own or an extended explanation of previous tasks. 
Additionally, it would have been nice to get solutions for the task so that we could compare. </li><li>While it is nice to discuss the solutions during the session, it would also be beneficial to provide sample solutions (especially for the more difficult questions)</li><li>I think it was very complicated to understand how to write the code. It would be helpful to have a step by step explanation to every task. I know that we could ask questions, but I would have asked, how I can do this completely. The introduction to Phyton was just too short and not really helpful. 
In the other bioinformatics class we had a bit more support and we had lesions just before the tutoring. </li></ol>

                <p class="field_title">Do you have any general criticism or suggestions regarding the organization or the content of the course, or the course as a whole?</p>
                <p><b>13 answer(s)</b></p><ol start="11"><li>In my case, I think the organization of the course was not made for beginners like me or for people who worked the first time with python. With the information provided by the  sheet or the tutors were not helpful to fulfill the task. I was completely overwhelmed and did not know what to do. It’s nice that they offered us help all the time but I could not take the offer because for me the tasks weren’t clear so I was not even able to ask a question.
Due to that I would have really appreciated if solutions were provided with detailed information about the code.
In general the organization was not efficient to succeed. It would have been better to first watch one video and then the practical part for this lecture the next lesson (and not all lectures first and then all practical courses).

</li><li>I would have liked a more general approach for implementing linear filters, but I got the necessary information upon asking</li><li>Es fehlten Angaben der Programmiersprache</li></ol>
