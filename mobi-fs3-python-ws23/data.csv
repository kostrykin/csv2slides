We watched the videos week by week and than had the tutorial every week directly after watching the video, sothat you have more knowledge memorized. Also for every tutorial we had a whole markdown sheet that gave an example how to use the code. After reading through the code I was able to use the code on a different dataset. Contrary in this course I constantly had the feeling that I can‘t do anything in python."

With the information provided by the  sheet or the tutors were not helpful to fulfill the task. I was completely overwhelmed and did not know what to do. It’s nice that they offered us help all the time but I could not take the offer because for me the tasks weren’t clear so I was not even able to ask a question.
Due to that I would have really appreciated if solutions were provided with detailed information about the code.
In general the organization was not efficient to succeed. It would have been better to first watch one video and then the practical part for this lecture the next lesson (and not all lectures first and then all practical courses).
